Even if you havenâ€™t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that E = mc 2, where in E represents energy (measured in Joules), m represents mass (measured in kilograms), and c represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per Albert Einstein et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.
